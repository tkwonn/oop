## OOP Practice

This repository contains my learning outputs and practice projects related to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).   
Each project focuses on different aspects of OOP, including class design and implementation.

### Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- Each project has its own dedicated directory.
- Within each project directory, you will find:
  - `Source code` files specific to that project.
  - `UML diagrams` illustrating the class relationships and interactions.
  - `Class Contracts` that provide detailed information about the constructors, properties, and methods of each class.
