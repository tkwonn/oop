## OOP Practice

This repository contains my learning outputs and practice projects related to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Each project focuses on different aspects of OOP.

### Repository Structure

Each project has its own dedicated directory. Within each project directory, you will find:
  - `Class Contracts` (contract.md) that provide detailed information about the constructors, properties, and methods of each class.
  - `Source code`
  - `UML diagrams` (UML.md) 
  - `relationship.md` illustrating the class relationships and interactions.

### How to run

```
$ git clone depth=1 url
```

For PHP,
go to directory with name php and run 
```php
$ php main.php
```

For TypeScript, run `tsc` in root directory and run
```
$ node dist/xxx.js
```

For Java,
go to directory with name java and run
```
$ javac
```
